### System Overview

The system is layered following a standard MVC pattern:

- **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Services:** Contain business logic.
- **DTOs:** Define data shapes.
- **Repositories/Data Layer:** Interfaces with the database.

### Modules and Flow

1. Incoming requests are routed to controllers.
2. Controllers validate and parse inputs using DTOs.
3. Business logic is processed in services.
4. Services interact with the data layer.
5. Responses are returned with DTOs.

### Configuration

- The application is configured using environment variables loaded at startup.
- Key configs include database connection details and server port.

### Data Flow

User clients send HTTP requests → Router directs requests → Controllers → Services → Database → Responses back to clients.

This modular approach allows clear separation of concerns and easy scalability.
