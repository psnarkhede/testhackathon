### System Overview
The system is structured as a modular application following typical layered architecture:

- **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests and route them to appropriate services.
- **Services:** Contain business logic and handle data processing.
- **Models/DTOs:** Define data structures.
- **Repositories:** Interact with the database.

### Module Interaction
- When a user makes an API request, the controller receives the request.
- Controllers call services to process data.
- Services may interact with repositories for database operations.
- Responses are formulated and sent back to the client.

### Data Flow Example
1. Client sends a GET request for a user.
2. Controller validates and forwards request to service.
3. Service fetches user data via repository.
4. Data is returned and formatted as a response DTO.
5. Controller sends JSON response back to client.

### Configuration
- Environment variables control settings like database connections.
- The `config` module centralizes configuration.
