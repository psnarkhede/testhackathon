## 1. Project Overview

**Description:**
This is a starter NestJS project utilizing the Nest framework, which is a progressive Node.js framework designed for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

**Technologies & Framework:**
- **Node.js** as the runtime environment
- **NestJS** (version 11.0.1) as the framework
- **TypeScript** for type-safe JavaScript
- Core dependencies include `@nestjs/common`, `@nestjs/core`, `@nestjs/platform-express`.


## 2. Setup Instructions

### Installing Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Project

- **Development mode:**
  
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

- **Watch mode (auto reload on change):**

  ```bash
  npm run start:dev
  ```

- **Production mode:**

  ```bash
  npm run start:prod
  ```

### Running Tests

- **Unit tests:**

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- **E2E (End-to-End) tests:**

  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```

- **Test coverage:**

  ```bash
  npm run test:cov
  ```

## 3. Project Structure

### Main Files:

- **`src/main.ts`** 
  - The application's entry point.
  - It creates and starts the NestJS application by bootstrapping the root `AppModule`.
  - Listens on a port defined by the environment variable `PORT` or defaults to 3000.

- **`src/app.module.ts`**
  - The root module of the application.
  - Organizes and aggregates different modules, controllers, and providers.

- **`src/app.controller.ts`**
  - Defines the HTTP request handlers (controllers).
  - Maps incoming requests to appropriate service methods.

- **`src/app.service.ts`**
  - Contains business logic.
  - Provides services that controllers consume.

### DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

- DTOs are TypeScript classes that define the shape of data sent over the network.
- They are used for input validation and data transformation, improving type safety and request/response consistency.

### Important folders/files:

- **`src/`** : Source code folder containing all application logic.
- **`test/`** : Contains end-to-end test specifications and testing setup.
- **`nest-cli.json`** : Configuration file for Nest CLI specifying source root and schematics.
- **`package.json`** : Holds project metadata, dependencies, and scripting commands.

## 4. API Endpoints Overview

> **Note:** The provided JSON does not include explicit controller or route definitions or DTO classes, so the exact endpoints, HTTP methods, and DTOs are not available. Please consult the actual source code in `src/app.controller.ts` for detailed routing information.

However, based on a typical NestJS starter project:

- The default route `/` likely exists and may respond to GET requests.
- Controllers handle routing and delegate to services for business logic.

To explore endpoints:
- Review `src/app.controller.ts` and check methods decorated with HTTP method decorators like `@Get()`, `@Post()`, etc.
- Look for DTO classes used as method parameters or response objects.

## 5. Testing

- **Testing Framework:** Jest is used for both unit and end-to-end testing.
- **Structure:**
  - Unit test files live alongside source files, typically named with `.spec.ts` suffix.
  - E2E tests are usually in the `test/` directory.
- **Running tests:**
  - Use `npm run test` for unit tests.
  - Use `npm run test:e2e` for e2e tests.
- **Example from typical NestJS `app.e2e-spec.ts`:**
  
  ```typescript
  import { Test, TestingModule } from '@nestjs/testing';
  import * as request from 'supertest';
  import { INestApplication } from '@nestjs/common';
  import { AppModule } from './../src/app.module';

  describe('AppController (e2e)', () => {
    let app: INestApplication;

    beforeAll(async () => {
      const moduleFixture: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({
        imports: [AppModule],
      }).compile();

      app = moduleFixture.createNestApplication();
      await app.init();
    });

    it('/ (GET)', () => {
      return request(app.getHttpServer())
        .get('/')
        .expect(200)
        .expect('Hello World!');
    });

    afterAll(async () => {
      await app.close();
    });
  });
  ```
