## User Manual

**Version:** [version]

---

*Note: Specific user interactions or example requests/responses are not provided due to lack of input data.*

This user manual is meant for non-technical users to understand how to interact with the system primarily through API calls. Typical usage involves:

- Identifying the required API endpoint for the desired action.
- Formatting your request according to the API's expected input format.
- Sending requests using tools or applications, such as a REST client.
- Receiving responses which will confirm actions or provide requested data.

For example, if you want to retrieve user information, you'd make a GET request to the `/users/{id}` endpoint, and the system would respond with user details.

Please provide detailed API interaction data for a more comprehensive user manual.
