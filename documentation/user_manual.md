1. Ensure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Running the Application

The project can be run in multiple modes based on your development needs.

- **Development mode:** Starts the application normally.

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

- **Watch mode:** Automatically restarts the application upon file changes.

  ```bash
  npm run start:dev
  ```

- **Debug mode:** Starts the application with debugging enabled and watch mode.

  ```bash
  npm run start:debug
  ```

- **Production mode:** Runs the compiled JavaScript code from the `dist` directory.

  ```bash
  npm run start:prod
  ```

---

## Testing Instructions

You can perform different types of tests using the available npm scripts:

- **Unit tests:** Run all unit tests.

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- **End-to-end (e2e) tests:** Run e2e tests using a specific Jest config.

  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```

- **Test coverage:** Generate a coverage report for your tests.

  ```bash
  npm run test:cov
  ```

- **Test watch mode:** Re-run tests on file changes.

  ```bash
  npm run test:watch
  ```

- **Test debug mode:** Run tests with debugging enabled.

  ```bash
  npm run test:debug
  ```

---

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy your NestJS application efficiently in a production environment, refer to the official deployment documentation at:

- [NestJS Deployment Documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment)

For cloud-based deployment on AWS, you can use the official platform Mau. It simplifies deployment with just a few commands:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/mau
mau deploy
```

Mau allows quick and easy deployment, freeing you to focus on development instead of infrastructure management.
