## Project Overview

Nest is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. This project is a Nest framework TypeScript starter repository designed to help developers quickly set up and develop applications using NestJS.

---

## Installation & Setup

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs both dependencies and devDependencies required to run, build, and test the project.

---

## Running the Application

You can run the application in several modes using npm scripts:

- **Development mode:**

  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```
  Starts the application in normal development mode.

- **Watch mode (development with file watching):**

  ```bash
  npm run start:dev
  ```
  Runs the application with auto-reloading when source files change.

- **Production mode:**

  ```bash
  npm run start:prod
  ```
  Runs the compiled JavaScript application from the `dist` directory.

- **Debug mode (watch with debugger):**

  ```bash
  npm run start:debug
  ```
  Starts the application in debug mode with watch enabled.

---

## Testing Instructions

The project uses Jest as the testing framework. You can run tests using the following commands:

- **Run unit tests:**

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- **Run end-to-end (e2e) tests:**

  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```

- **Run tests with coverage report:**

  ```bash
  npm run test:cov
  ```

- **Run tests in watch mode:**

  ```bash
  npm run test:watch
  ```

- **Run tests in debug mode:**

  ```bash
  npm run test:debug
  ```

---

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy your NestJS application efficiently, follow the best practices outlined in the [NestJS deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment).

For cloud deployments, you can use **NestJS Mau**, an official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. It simplifies the deployment process:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/mau
mau deploy
```

Mau allows deploying your application with just a few clicks, focusing on features instead of infrastructure management.
