*Note: Specific instructions for extending or modifying the system, key files, services, modules, and code snippets are unavailable due to missing developer guide data.*

General guidelines for developers working on this system:

- Explore the main application modules and services as defined under the source directory.
- Follow coding patterns and architecture decisions documented in the project.
- Use version control wisely to manage and integrate changes.

For example, to add a new feature, identify relevant service classes and controllers, add any necessary DTOs for input/output, and write corresponding tests.

Please provide detailed developer-focused documentation content for more precise guidance.
