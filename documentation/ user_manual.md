Welcome to the system! This guide will help you understand how you can use our APIs to interact with your data without needing technical knowledge.

### How to Use the API

You can think of APIs as doors that let you talk to our system. For example, if you want to see all the users in your account, you would send a simple request to the `/users` door.

- To get the list of users, simply call the GET method on `/users`:

  **Request:** Just send a GET request to our APIâ€™s user endpoint.

  **Response:** You will get back a list of users like this:

  ```json
  [
    {"id": "123", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"},
    {"id": "124", "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com"}
  ]
  ```

- To add a new user, send a POST request with the new user's name and email:

  **Request:**
  ```json
  {
    "name": "New User",
    "email": "newuser@example.com"
  }
  ```

  **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": "125",
    "name": "New User",
    "email": "newuser@example.com"
  }
  ```

### Summary
Just send your requests to the right endpoint and include the needed information. The system will reply with confirmation or data you requested.
