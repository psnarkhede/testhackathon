### Overview
The system is designed as a modular web API application focused on user management.

### Modules
- **Controllers:** Handle incoming API requests and respond.
- **Services:** Contain business logic separate from the API layer.
- **Models:** Define data structures and database schemas.
- **DTOs:** Data Transfer Objects for validating incoming requests.

### Data Flow
1. Client sends HTTP request to API endpoint.
2. Controller receives the request and validates input using DTOs.
3. Controller calls appropriate service methods.
4. Services interact with Models/Database.
5. Service returns data to Controller.
6. Controller sends response back to client.

### Configuration
- Environment variables configure database, ports, and other settings.
- Main entry file `src/main.ts` bootstraps the app.
