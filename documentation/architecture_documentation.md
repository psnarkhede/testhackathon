### System Overview

The system is a modular backend application built on **NestJS** framework, using **TypeScript**. It follows the **layered architecture pattern** with clear separation of concerns among controllers, services, and data layers.

### Module Structure

- **Controllers:** Handle incoming HTTP requests and forward them to the appropriate services.
- **Services:** Contain core business logic and interact with repositories for data handling.
- **DTOs:** Define the structure of data for request validation and response shaping.

### Data Flow

1. **Incoming Request:** Hits the controller.
2. **Validation:** Request DTOs validate and parse input data.
3. **Business Logic:** Controllers call services to process data.
4. **Persistence:** Services interact with database repositories.
5. **Response:** Processed data returned to users via controllers.

### Configuration

- Centralized config files manage environment variables and app settings.
- Uses ORM for database abstraction.

### Tests

- Unit and integration tests cover controllers and services.
- Tests use mocks and in-memory data stores for isolation.

### README Highlights

- Installation instructions
- Environment variable requirements
- How to run the project locally and deploy

The system emphasizes scalability and maintainability by strict adherence to clean code principles and design patterns.
