### Overview

The system is designed as a modular backend API application leveraging a layered architecture:

- **Controllers:** API-entry points that handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Services:** Contain business logic, orchestrate data manipulation and validation.
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Define the shape of data flowing through the system.
- **Authentication Module:** Provides secure token-based authentication using JWT.

### Project Structure

```
/src
  /controllers    # API route handlers
  /services       # Business logic
  /dtos           # Data schemas
  /auth           # Authentication handling
  main.ts         # Application entry
/tests           # Unit and integration tests
package.json      # Project dependencies and scripts
README.md         # Project overview and docs
```

### Configuration

- Environment variables are used to keep secrets and configuration flexible.
- The JWT secret and database URLs must be set in `.env`.

### Data Flow

1. API clients send HTTP requests to **Controllers**.
2. Controllers validate inputs via DTOs.
3. Requests are passed to **Services** for core logic.
4. Services interact with data stores or other services.
5. Responses are formed and returned through Controllers to the client.

### Authentication Flow

- The `/auth/login` endpoint issues JWTs after validating user credentials.
- Protected routes (e.g., `/profile`) require a valid token in HTTP headers.

### Testing

- Tests are structured to cover controllers and services.
- Continuous integration setup ensures quality on code changes.

This modular design ensures maintainability, scalability, and security of the system.
