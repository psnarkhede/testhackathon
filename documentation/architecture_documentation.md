## Architecture Documentation

### Version: 1.4.2-release

This document provides a high-level overview of the system's design and structure.

---

### Overview
The system is built using a modular architecture with separation of concerns.

### Modules
- **User Module**: Responsible for user management functions, including login, profile management, and updating user details.
- **Auth Module**: Handles authentication, token generation, and validation.
- **API Layer**: REST controllers expose services endpoints.

---

### Data Flow
1. Client sends an HTTP request to the API server.
2. API controllers receive and validate incoming data.
3. Controllers delegate business logic to Services.
4. Services interact with the database through repositories (not shown in detail here).
5. Services return processed data to controllers.
6. Controllers send JSON responses back to clients.

---

### Technologies
- **NestJS** framework provides the foundation.
- **TypeScript** is the language for all codebase.
- **JWT** for stateless user authentication.

---

### Configuration
- Environment variables control service configurations.
- `config` module centralizes configuration access.
