**Architecture Documentation**

**Version:** [object Object].version

### Overview

The system is based on a modular architecture following clean separation of concerns.

### Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains all source code.
  - **main.ts**: Bootstraps the application.
  - **app.module.ts**: Root module that imports feature modules.
  - **users/**: Dedicated module for User feature, with controllers, services, and DTOs.

### Modules and Services
- **UsersModule**: Handles user-related functionality.
  - **UsersController**: Handles HTTP requests.
  - **UsersService**: Contains business logic.

### Data Flow
1. Client sends HTTP request to controller.
2. Controller validates and forwards request to service.
3. Service processes logic and interacts with data layer (repositories).
4. Service returns result to controller.
5. Controller sends HTTP response back to client.

### Configurations
- Environment-specific variables configured via `.env`.
- Application settings located in config files as per README.

### Testing
- Located under `test/` folder.
- Uses Jest framework for unit and integration tests.

This layered approach ensures maintainability and scalability.
