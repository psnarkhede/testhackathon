## 1. Project Overview

### Description
This project is a starter repository built with the [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework. NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework designed for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications using TypeScript.

### Technologies and Frameworks Used
- **Node.js:** Backend runtime environment.
- **NestJS:** A TypeScript framework for scalable Node.js applications.
- **TypeScript:** Typed superset of JavaScript used throughout the project.
- **Jest:** Testing framework for unit and end-to-end (e2e) tests.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** For code linting and formatting.
- **RxJS:** For reactive programming.
- **Class-validator & Class-transformer:** For input validation and transforming plain objects.

The project follows the architectural style and best practices encouraged by NestJS.

## 2. Setup Instructions

### Install Dependencies
Run this command in the project root directory to install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the Project

- **Development Mode:** Start the server with hot-reload for faster development.
  ```bash
  npm run start:dev
  ```

- **Production Mode:** Compile and run the application in production.
  ```bash
  npm run start:prod
  ```

- **Normal Start:** Start the application normally (usually development without watch).
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

### Running Tests

- **Run Unit Tests:** Execute all unit tests.
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- **Run E2E Tests:** Execute end-to-end test cases.
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```

- **Test Coverage:** Get a coverage report for tests.
  ```bash
  npm run test:cov
  ```

## 3. Project Structure

### Important Files
- **`src/main.ts`**
  - Application entry point.
  - Responsible for bootstrapping the NestJS application and starting the server.
  
- **`src/app.module.ts`**
  - Root module of the application.
  - Bundles different modules, controllers, and providers into one cohesive unit.

- **`src/app.controller.ts`**
  - Defines request handlers for incoming API requests.
  - Routes calls to appropriate service methods.

- **`src/app.service.ts`**
  - Contains business logic.
  - Provides data or performs operations requested by controllers.

### Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- DTOs are TypeScript classes that define the shape of data for requests or responses.
- They help validate incoming data and document the structure expected by the API.
- Typically reside alongside controllers and services.

### Other Folders and Files
- **`src/`**
  - Contains source TypeScript files.
  - Includes modules, controllers, services, and DTOs.

- **`test/`**
  - Contains test files, including e2e test specifications.

- **`nest-cli.json`**
  - Nest CLI configuration specifying source root and build options.

- **`package.json`**
  - Lists project dependencies, scripts, and versioning.

## 4. API Endpoints Overview

> **Note:** Specific controllers and endpoints are inferred based on typical NestJS starters and provided files.

### Root Endpoint
- **HTTP Method:** GET
- **Path:** `/`
- **Request DTO:** None
- **Response DTO:** String message

#### What it does:
Returns a simple welcome message or status indicating that the API is running.

### Additional Endpoints
- Since only default starter files are included, no custom endpoints are defined yet. New endpoints will be added in `*.controller.ts` files.

> **Tip:** Look for files ending with `.controller.ts` to find API routes and their corresponding methods.


---

## 5. Testing

### Testing Structure
- Unit tests are written using **Jest**, located within the `src` folder with filenames ending in `.spec.ts`.
- End-to-end (e2e) tests are placed in the `test` directory and use Jest configuration from `test/jest-e2e.json`.

### How to Run Tests
- Run unit tests:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- Run e2e tests:
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```

- Run tests in watch mode (reruns tests on file changes):
  ```bash
  npm run test:watch
  ```

### Example from `app.e2e-spec.ts`
> (File not provided but generally would include tests such as):

```typescript
import { Test, TestingModule } from '@nestjs/testing';
import * as request from 'supertest';
import { AppModule } from './../src/app.module';

describe('AppController (e2e)', () => {
  let app;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    const moduleFixture: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({
      imports: [AppModule],
    }).compile();

    app = moduleFixture.createNestApplication();
    await app.init();
  });

  it('/ (GET)', () => {
    return request(app.getHttpServer())
      .get('/')
      .expect(200)
      .expect('Hello World!');
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await app.close();
  });
});
```

This confirms that the root endpoint `/` returns a 200 OK status and the expected string message.
