## 1. Project Overview

This project is a starter repository for building efficient and scalable server-side applications using the **NestJS** framework. NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework that leverages TypeScript and modern JavaScript to provide an out-of-the-box architecture suited for building enterprise-grade applications.

### Technologies & Framework Details:
- **Node.js** as the runtime environment
- **NestJS** framework (v11.x)
- **TypeScript** as the primary programming language
- Uses **Express.js** platform under the hood
- Supports features like Dependency Injection, Modular Architecture, and Decorators

## 2. Setup Instructions

### Installing Dependencies
Run the following command in the project root to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Project
- **Development mode:**
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```
- **Watch mode (auto-reload on changes):**
  ```bash
  npm run start:dev
  ```
- **Production mode:**
  ```bash
  npm run start:prod
  ```

### Running Tests
- **Unit tests:**
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
- **End-to-end (e2e) tests:**
  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```
- **Test coverage report:**
  ```bash
  npm run test:cov
  ```

## 3. Project Structure

The project source files are located in the `src` directory, configured as the `sourceRoot`.

### Main files:
- **main.ts**  
  Entry point of the application. It bootstraps the NestJS application by creating an instance of the `AppModule` and then starts listening on a configured port (default 3000).

- **app.module.ts**  
  The root module that organizes the application structure by importing other modules, providers, and controllers.

- **app.controller.ts**  
  Contains route handlers (controller methods) that respond to client requests.

- **app.service.ts**  
  Contains business logic or service methods used by controllers.

### DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- DTOs define the shape of data sent over the network and help with validation and type safety.
- They are usually TypeScript classes decorated with validation decorators from packages like `class-validator`.

### Important Folders / Files
- `src/` : Contains application source code.
- `test/` : Usually contains end-to-end tests (not explicitly present based on provided files).
- `package.json` : Defines scripts, dependencies, and project metadata.
- `README.md` : Project documentation and useful resources.

## 4. API Endpoints Overview

*Note: Since no explicit controllers or endpoints beyond basic starter files were provided, here is the default understanding based on typical NestJS starter app.*

- **GET /**
  - **Path:** `/`
  - **Method:** GET
  - **Request DTO:** None
  - **Response DTO:** None (returns a welcome string message)
  - **Description:** Returns a welcome message or basic response.

*For further endpoints and their DTOs, check the controller files in `src` once added.*

## 5. Testing

Testing is structured using Jest as the testing framework.

- Unit tests typically reside alongside source files with the `.spec.ts` extension.
- End-to-end tests can be run using the dedicated script `npm run test:e2e` which looks for tests configured in `test/jest-e2e.json`.

Example test file (not provided but inferred):
- `app.e2e-spec.ts`: Contains e2e test cases to test the application from the outside in, ensuring routes and major behaviors work as expected.

To run tests:
```bash
npm run test       # for unit tests
npm run test:e2e   # for end-to-end tests
```
